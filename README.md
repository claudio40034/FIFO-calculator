# Fifo projects written in C/C++
----------------NOT COMPLETED---------------------
This is a repository regarding the world of the IPC. All the projects are written in C/C++. I'd like to share, improve my developer skill with the IPC and listen other tips. 
Project '001' = FIFO with shared memory trying to fix race condition and busy waiting. We have two mains: mainClient.cpp (we can launch a maximum of 4 clients) and a mainServer.cpp (there isn't a real check of the number of servers but the idea is that only one server is executed)
